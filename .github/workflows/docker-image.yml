  schedule:
    # The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.
    # Note: The schedule event can be delayed during periods of high loads of GitHub Actions workflow runs.
    # High load times include the start of every hour.
    # To decrease the chance of delay, schedule your workflow to run at a different time of the hour.
    # Prime numbers are a good example for time of the hour: 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53
    # Example: every 5 minutes.
    # - cron: '*/5 * * * *'
    # Currently: every day at 10:23am UTC.
    - cron: "23 10 * * *"
